Hey!

I've been working as a software developer with a special interest on data topics. I have the bachelor degree from Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Computer Engineering and the MSc degree from ITU Computer Engineering Data Mining. I've also studied in Technische Universität München as an erasmus student for 6 months.  

I've worked for Arcelik AS for over 5 years, and after that I've joined to ThoughtWorks. My ThoughtWorks journey has started in Istanbul, and now I'm working in London.  

You can find me on LinkedIn or twitter. Feel free to send any questions, comments or anything at all!
