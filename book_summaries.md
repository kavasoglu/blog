I'm planning to monitor and organise my book reading habit. Also, I'll remember the book names exactly when I wanna talk about them if I write them down here :)

I'll try to put a little summary for each down for the future reference.

The books that I've read so far:
- Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists Book by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido (WR: 1 July 2019)


* WR: When I Read
