<p>Hey!</p>

<p>I'm going to share my learnings about data science now and again. This is mainly because I want to keep my notes organized and tidy to easily find the things that I need, so mainly to help myself :)</p>

<p>In the meantime, I'm happy to serve anyone going through the similar path on data science to ease their process.</p>

<p>Feel free to send me any comments or feedback!</p>

<p>PS: I'm new to Jekyll, so probably gonna learn & add the features by time. If there are some cool and easy things to do right away just let me know!</p>

{% assign sorted_pages = site.data_science | sort:"order" %}
{% for node in sorted_pages %}
    <li style="font-size: 23px" ><span class="entry-title"><a href="{{ node.url }}"> {{ node.title }} </a></span></li>
{% endfor %}
