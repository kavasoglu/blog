<p>Hey!</p>

<p>I'm going to share my learnings about data science now and again. This is mainly because I want to keep my notes organized and tidy to easily find things that I need, so mainly to help myself :)</p>

<p>In the meantime, I'm happy to serve anyone going through the similar path on data science to ease their process.</p>

<p>Feel free to send me any comments or feedback!</p>

<p>PS: I'm new to Jekyll, so probably gonna learn & add the features by time. If there are some cool and easy things to do right away just let me know!</p>
